My name is Jeremy, and you can find me here at [jrmylow.com]({{site.url}}). I help people solve problems in planning and coordination, and dealing with complex systems at scale.

I've been privileged to work across ambitious projects and programmes across government, healthcare, financial services, engineering, and infrastructure. If you would like to talk about this, please drop me an [email](mailto:{{site.author.email}}).

### Open Invitation
**If you want to talk tech, engineering, and systems, I want to talk to you** If you would like to get in touch, please reach out via [email](mailto:{{site.author.email}}) or any of my socials [here](/contact). 

**I enjoy reading and talking about problems, patterns, and solutions in any domain**. If you have written something and would like someone to read a draft, please feel free to send it my way.

### Purpose
I am writing this to help me think better about interesting problems. Beyond that, I hope that some people will find the things I write about (a) true, and (b) useful.

The [most important problems](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) that I think and write about are:
* Systems of how people solve (knowledge) problems - including getting better at problem-solving. 
* Systems of how people set up feedback loops to help them understand the world (or at least their business). I'm particularly interested in:
  * What the "right" thing to instrument is
  * How people build understanding from the data they see
  * Hoe people use that understanding to make their systems better
* Systems of how people build shared understandings across disciplines
